= Loading a Mesh

The next step is to load a mesh.

The `loadMesh` function has a `_name` option set by default as the
default value of the `--gmsh.filename` option that point either to a `.geo`, either to a `.msh`, or a `.h5` file. 

Meshes in general are more detailed in this xref:dev:reference:Mesh/README.adoc[section].

[source,c++]
----
auto mesh=loadMesh( _mesh=new Mesh<Simplex<2>> );
----

== Exporting the Mesh for visualisation

See this xref:06-VisualizingFunctions.adoc[section] for more details about exporting and visualizing meshes.

== Implementation

An implementation reads as follows:
[source,c++]
----
include::example$03-mymesh.cpp[]
----

and the associated config file

[source,cfg]

include::example$03-mymesh.cfg[]
